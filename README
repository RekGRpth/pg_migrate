pg_migrate
A lightweight utility to manage postgres schema, views, triggers, and functions.

pg_migrate will recursively traverse a directory tree and run sql files postfixed with -up.sql or -down.sql. Down migrations are intended to rollback the operations defined in their up counterparts.

usage: pg_migrate -H [options]... dir

	-H        Host (in postgres URI format)
	-h        Show help text
	-v        Show version information
	-s        Show last 10 forward migrations ran
	-u        Migrate forward. Recursively traverses provided directory for -up.sql files
	-d        Migrate rollback. Will attempt to locate matching -down.sql files to migrate backwards
	-p        Soft run. Will display migrations to be ran / rolled back
	-g        Provisions the public schema with the pg_migrate table, used to track migrations


Installation

The release binary is compiled against amd64 linux (ubuntu) and therefore will only work on that system architecture. You may download source and `make build` to compile locally.

Before first run, you must provision the database by running pg_migrate with the -g and -H flags. This is to create the `public.pg_migrate` table, which stores information about which migrations have been ran:
`pg_migrate -H postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/postgres -g`


example:
`pg_migrate -H postgres://postgres:pass@localhost:5432/postgres -p -d .`
simulate an up migration for everything in this directory tree


Notes

- Files are transactional unless there are explicit transactions within. The migration will abort if any statement within the file fail.
- Corresponding up and down migrations must be in the same directory
